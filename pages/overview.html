        <h1>Overview of Exploration Activities</h1>
        <section>
           
            <p>
                There are a range of activities that may be undertaken as part of an exploration program. These activities are dependent on a number of factors, including the nature of the mineral being sought and the geology of the area. Exploration generally progresses from low impact activities before progressing to more intense and costly activities like drilling. Geological mapping is generally undertaken by a geologist walking over the ground of interest. Geologists observe the location, orientation, and characteristics of the rocks or sediments exposed at the land’s surface. This information can then be used to prepare a geological map of the exploration area, recording the rock types and structures.

            <h2>Geochemical surveys</h2>
            <p>
                Geochemical surveys are undertaken to target areas for further exploration. 
                The surveys usually involve the collection of samples of soils, rock and/or sediments.
                 These samples are sent for laboratory analysis to identify areas of potential mineralisation.
                  The surveys could include Soil sampling – is undertaken usually using hand-held tools such as shovels, picks,
                 and hand augers to collect samples of soil and subsoil. 
            </p>
            <p>Stream sediment sampling – involves collection of samples of sediment within drainage lines. 
                Samples are typically extracted using hand tools and may be sieved during collection. Rock chip sampling – typically involves collecting up to a few kilograms of rock material using hand-held tools. 
                Rock chip samples may be collected during geological mapping programs.</p>

            <h2>Explanation of common exploration techniques</h2>
            <h3>Medium / Higher Impact Geophysical surveys</h3>
            <p>Geophysical surveys assist in identifying different rock types and can help identify resources. 
                Geophysical surveys aim to detect various physical properties such as the magnetism below the surface of the Earth,
                 or its response to electricity, vibration, or magnetism in different forms. Different geophysical surveys measure various physical properties of the Earth and any mineral deposits using a variety of different applications and equipment.
                  Geophysical surveys can be conducted from the air, on the ground, or down drill holes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Airborne surveys </strong>Airborne geophysical surveys – may comprise magnetic, radiometric, gravity, or electromagnetic surveys. These surveys provide general geological information over an area and are often used in the initial stages of exploration. These surveys can be undertaken using drones, low flying helicopters, or light aircraft which fly in a grid pattern. The instruments may be either mounted inside the aircraft or towed underneath. Depending on the type of survey, the aircraft may fly between 25 and 60 metres above the ground, with flight lines spaced between 25 and 200 metres apart. 
                Landholders are notified when the survey will be taking place by advertisement in a local newspaper or similar.</p>

                <p><strong>Ground-based surveys </strong>Seismic surveys - measure variation in reflected ground vibration as it passes through the Earth. The surveys use an energy source to create the high frequency vibrations, which can be truck mounted vibrating weights or a simple hammer hit depending on the scale of the survey. Small sensors are linked by cables and spread either side of the source to detect and relay the vibrations as they return to the surface. Seismic surveys provide information about rocks down to depths of several kilometres and are particularly suited to flat-lying sedimentary basins.</p>
                <p><strong>Induced Polarisation (IP) surveys </strong>– use any electric field in the ground and measures the chargeability and resistivity of the subsurface. The technique can identify differences in resistivity arising from aquifers, metallic minerals, and stratigraphy. Readings are taken by a small crew who shift a ground array of transmission and receiver cables. They are most often used in metallic mineral exploration.</p>
                <p><strong>Radiometric surveys</strong> - measure gamma rays which are continuously being emitted from the Earth by natural decomposition of some common radiogenic minerals. The surveys focus on recording the isotopes of potassium, thorium, and uranium. Generally, most gamma rays emanate from the top 30 centimetres of rock or soil and can be detected by airborne surveys or on surface rocks using a hand-held spectrometer. They are most often used in metallic and industrial mineral exploration. Magnetic surveys - measure the variations of the Earth’s magnetic field due to the presence of magnetic minerals. Subtle variations in the abundance of magnetic minerals are used to interpret rock types and can assist in identifying mineral resources. These surveys are typically undertaken by a geophysical technician on foot carrying a magnetometer and a sensor on a pole. They are most often used in metallic mineral exploration. Gravity surveys - the gravity field is measured with a gravimeter to determine variations in rock density in the Earth’s crust. Ground gravity surveys require a geophysical technician to take gravity measurements at set intervals of distance and record the precise height at each location. Access to the recording sites can be by vehicle or helicopter, depending upon remoteness. They are used in mineral and energy exploration.</p>
                <p><strong>Electromagnetic (EM) surveys</strong> - induce an electromagnetic field and measure the three-dimensional variations in conductivity within the near-surface soil and rock. Conductive rock units can be studied to locate metallic minerals and to understand groundwater and salinity. Ground readings are taken by a small crew who shift a ground array of transmission and receiver cables. Downhole geophysical surveys - utilise completed or partially completed drill holes to allow access for geophysical tools. These tools may be used to detect variations in the magnetic, radiometric, or electrical character of the rocks adjacent to the drill hole. The surveys may also be used to determine the exact path of the drill hole. They typically require a small truck and a range of downhole tools. Occasionally tools with a small radiometric source may be used and a detailed risk assessment is required to ensure that the tool is not lost down the hole.</p>
