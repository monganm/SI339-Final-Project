            <h2>The Importance of Critical Minerals</h2>
            <p>
                The Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), the EU’s attempt to address this challenge, passed the European Parliament in December 2023 and was given final approval by the European Council in March 2024. The act also promotes international cooperation to ensure a diversified supply chain and reduce trade dependencies.

            </p>
            <p>Through the act, EU leaders want to ensure the supply of 34 mined minerals, concentrates and metals, otherwise dubbed “critical raw materials” (CRMs). Without CRMs, which include minerals such as lithium and cobalt (used in battery production), rocks like coking coal (used in steel production) and exotic rare earths such as scandium and neodymium (used in renewables), Europe’s industry would grind to a halt in a very short space of time.

            <h2>Driving a Sustainable Future</h2>
            <p>
                Global increase demand and estimation of additional mines require to address demand.
To protect the EU’s industrial base, the Critical Raw Materials Act commits member states to hit three goals by 2030: 
<li>10% of CRMs to be extracted locally</li>
    <li>40% to be processed</li> 
    <li>25% to be recovered by recycling.</li>
    <p>These are steep targets. Some CRMs, like the rare earth neodymium, are fully sourced outside of Europe. At present, the EU is the main producer of only one CRM: Hafnium.
    </p>
    
    <section><p>Remapping Europe’s geology from the air may well highlight new sources of CRMs or improve our understanding of known deposits. While the chances of finding CRM deposits in the EU are good, getting them out of the ground is a different proposition. Mines can take decades to actually come to fruition. To help speed up permitting, the Critical Raw Materials (CRM)  Act allows European countries to designate CRM-related projects, such as mines and refineries, as “strategically important” with accelerated and prioritised permitting decisions. 
    </p>
<p>Despite geological advantages and the CRMA fast-tracking permitting, experts feel that the EU is very unlikely to meet the CRM’s 10% extraction target by 2030. The biggest challenge in getting there will be gaining public support for new mines. More positive is the hope for a circular future scenario called “Sustainability Alliance”. In this vision, CRMs are domestically sourced, highly valued and brought back into circulation at high rates. In this regard, the European Unions’ push for sustainable CRM sourcing will be a catalyst for a complete move toward circularity across the entire supply chain, from extraction to repair and everything from underground mines (which at their end of life “could be used for energy storage”) to cars and phones will be built with circularity at their core. Advanced, low-impact mining is tolerated and encouraged, and this is a priority focus for Geoteclite. More specifically, focus has been focussed on low impact exploration techniques and building capacity in the shallow  and deep drilling sectors for geothermal, geotechnical, water and mineral resource resources.
