                Geophysical surveys assist in identifying different rock types and can help identify resources. Geophysical surveys aim to detect various physical properties such as the magnetism below the surface of the Earth, or its response to electricity, vibration, or magnetism in different forms. Different geophysical surveys measure various physical properties of the Earth and any mineral deposits using a variety of different applications and equipment. Geophysical surveys can be conducted from the air, on the ground, or down drill holes.
